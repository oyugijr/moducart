## 🎯 Weekly Implementation Strategy

### **Weekly Structure:**

```text
Monday-Wednesday: Core Implementation
- Build features according to phase
- Focus on functionality

Thursday: Security Implementation
- Add security layers to features built
- Security testing

Friday: Learning & Documentation
- Code review
- Document what we learned
- Plan next week
```

### **Security-First Mindset:**

For each feature, we'll implement:

1. **Authentication** - Who is accessing?
2. **Authorization** - What are they allowed to do?
3. **Validation** - Is the input safe?
4. **Sanitization** - Clean the data
5. **Encryption** - Protect sensitive data

## 🛠️ Technology Learning Path

### **Progressive Learning Approach:**

1. **Start Simple**: Basic Express routes
2. **Add Complexity**: Database integration
3. **Implement Security**: Authentication & validation
4. **Scale**: Microservices communication
5. **Optimize**: Performance & monitoring

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

By the end, you'll have practical experience with:

- Microservices architecture
- Multiple databases
- Authentication & authorization
- Security best practices
- Docker containerization
- Message queues
- gRPC communication
- Testing strategies
- Deployment pipelines
